Two of the most significant developments in this regard have been cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), both of which have had a profound impact on the way we interact with technology. Cloud computing, which allows users to store and process data on remote servers accessed via the internet, revolutionized the way businesses and individuals manage information. IoT devices, ranging from smart home gadgets to industrial sensors, collect and share data over the internet, enabling new levels of automation, efficiency, and convenience.\n"
