# Error Alert Resolution Document

This document outlines a general approach for addressing system errors triggered by excessive memory usage. It provides guidance on the cause of such errors and the recommended remedial measures to help restore normal operation.

## Error Cause

The error is triggered when the systemâ€™s memory usage exceeds a critical threshold (typically above 95%). When memory utilization reaches this level, the system is at risk of performance degradation or failure, prompting an automated error alert.

## Recommended Remedial Actions

1. **Identify High Memory Consumers:**  
   Monitor system processes to identify those consuming significant memory resources. Ensure that the process generating the alert is not mistakenly targeted.

2. **Terminate the Secondary Python Process:**  
   Instead of stopping the currently running Python program that issued the alert, locate and terminate the Python process that is using the next highest amount of memory. This action helps reduce overall memory consumption without affecting the main monitoring or management process.

3. **Follow-Up Verification:**  
   After terminating the identified process, verify that memory usage returns to acceptable levels. Continue to monitor system performance and investigate underlying causes to prevent recurrence.

## Conclusion

By promptly addressing high memory usage and carefully managing process termination, this approach helps maintain system stability and prevents further errors. Adhering to these guidelines ensures that the resolution process is both effective and minimally disruptive.
